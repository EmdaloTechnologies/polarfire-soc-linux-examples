# PolarFire SoC Linux Examples

This repository contains a number of example applications that can be used to explore the features of the icicle kit.
These examples will be automatically included as part of the icicle kit Buildroot and Yocto images, in the `/opt/microchip/` directory. These images will contain both the source code for the examples as well as precompiled binaries where possible.

## Hardware Requirements:     
PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit (MPFS250T-FCVG484EES)

## Pre-Requisites:    
Before running any of these example applications, set up the Icicle kit and ensure Linux can be booted as explained in [Updating PolarFire SoC Icicle-Kit FPGA Design and Linux Image.](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/master/boards/mpfs-icicle-kit-es/updating-icicle-kit/updating-icicle-kit-design-and-linux.md)
